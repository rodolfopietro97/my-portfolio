This is the personal my personal Portfolio page.
If you want find more information about me visit [my website](https://www.rodolfopietro.it/).

I'm Rodolfo Pietro Calabrò. **Blockchain Software Developer Engineer**, **Full Stack Software Developer**, **Creative Coder**, **Data Scientist** and **Nerd in the soul :D**.

I like Computer Science, Innovation, Blockchain Technologies, Finance and Sport.

I have enjoyed Computer Science since I was 13 years old, and it was love at first sight. 

This subject is very wide, but my main areas of interest remain **Innovation**, **Blockchain Technologies**, **Software Development**, **Data Science**, and **Finance (DeFI and Classical Finance)**.

Anyway, in general, I'm open to any kind of innovative type of project, that's because I enjoy creating new things and I strongly believe in innovation.

I've put my passion under many experiences in a lot of projects from Blockchain Technologies and Parallel Calculus to Frontend and Game Design.

Programming and learning new technologies, by the way, is, of course, an everyday challenge.

Like everybody I have some professional goals such as:
* Learning
* Innovating and Creating
* Be happy about getting up from my bed saying "How beautiful today is. I will work on something I love."
